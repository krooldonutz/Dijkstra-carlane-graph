# Dijkstra-carlane-graph
Application of Dijkstra's algorithm on a changing graph

As a smart student you are always trying to optimise the driving time to your early morning
algorithms lectures so that you can sleep more. You will be leveraging your algorithms skills
to get an optimal solution.
Some of the roads in your city have carpool lanes that can only be used if there are at least 2
persons in the car, so you have to decide if you will be giving a ride to a fellow student or not.
You have access to precise travel time information among key locations in your city, both with
single car occupancy and with 2 or more persons in the car. And you have a list of locations
in which there are students looking for a ride to the same destination you are going. You can
assume that the potential passengers are always on time at the agreed location and there will
be no additional time incurred for getting them into the car. You will either pickup passenger(s) with the same destination as you, or go alone the whole trip. Your absolute priority
during those very early morning hours is maximising your sleeping time, so you are looking
for the shortest total driving time and will not give a ride if that increases the total driving time.
